  <title>The Wonderful World of Cosets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have already seen one way we can examine a complicated group <m>G</m>:
      namely, study its subgroups, whose group structures are in some
      cases much more directly understandable than the structure of <m>G</m>
      itself. But if <m>H</m> is a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>, if we only study
      <m>H</m> we lose all the information about <m>G</m>'s structure <q>outside</q> of
      <m>H</m>. We might hope that <m>G-H</m> (that is, the set of elements of <m>G</m>
      that are not in <m>H</m>) is also a subgroup of <m>G</m>, but we immediately
      see that cannot be the case since the identity element of <m>G</m> must
      be in <m>H</m>, and <m>H\cap (G-H)=\emptyset</m>. Instead, let's ask how we
      can get at some understanding of <m>G</m>'s entire structure using a
      subgroup <m>H</m>? It turns out we use what are called <em>cosets</em> of
      <m>H</m>; but before we get to those, we need to cover some preliminary
      material.

  <title>Partitions of and equivalence relations
  on sets</title>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a set. Then a collection of subsets
        <m>P=\{S_i\}_{i\in I}</m> (where <m>I</m> is some index set) is a <term>partition</term> of <m>S</m> if each <m>S_i \neq \emptyset</m> and each element
        of <m>S</m> is in exactly one <m>S_i</m>. In other words,
        <m>P=\{S_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a partition of <m>S</m> if and only if:
        <ol>
          <li>
       
            <p>
              each <m>S_i\neq \emptyset</m>;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>            <p>
              the <m>S_i</m> are mutually disjoint (that is, <m>S_i\cap S_j =
              \emptyset</m> for <m>i\neq j \in I</m>); and
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>S=\bigcup_{i\in I}S_i</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        The <m>S_i</m> are called the <term>cells</term> of the partition.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> has 5 partitions: namely,
            <me>
              \{\{1,2,3\}\},\{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}, \{\{1,3\},\{2\}\},\{\{2,3\},\{1\}\} \text{ and }  \{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}.
            </me>
            The first partition we've mentioned has one cell, the next three have
            two cells, and the last one has three cells.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The following is a 2-celled partition of <m>\Z</m>:
            <me>
              \{\{x\in \Z\,:\ x \text{
              is even} \},\{x\in \Z\,:\, x\text{ is odd} \}\}.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    The number of partitions of a finite set of <m>n</m> elements gets
    large very quickly as <m>n</m> goes to infinity. Indeed, there are 52
    partitions of a set containing just 5 elements!<fn>The total
    number of partitions of an <m>n</m>-element set is the <em>Bell number</em>,
    <m>B_n</m>. There is no trivial way of computing <m>B_n</m>, in general,
    though the <m>B_n</m> do satisfy the relatively simple recurrence
    relation
    <me>
      B_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} B_k,
    </me>
    for each <m>n\geq 1</m>.</fn>But our goal here is not to count the number of
    partitions of a given set, but rather to use particular partitions
    of a group <m>G</m> to help us study that group's structure. We turn now
    to our next definition.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a set. Then a <term>relation</term> on <m>S</m> is a
        subset <m>R</m> of <m>S\times S</m>.<fn>More generally, if <m>S</m> and
        <m>T</m> are sets, a <em>relation between <m>S</m> and <m>T</m></em> is a subset
        of <m>S \times T</m>. We will not, however, in our class consider
        the cases in which <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are different sets.</fn>If <m>R</m> is
        a relation on <m>S</m> and <m>x,y\in S</m>, then we say <m>x</m> is <term>related to</term> <m>y</m>, and write <m>x R y</m>, if <m>(x,y)\in R</m>;
        otherwise, we say that <m>x</m> is <term>not related</term> to <m>y</m>, and
        write <m>x \not R y</m>.

  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      If there is a conventional notation used to denote
      a particular relation on a set, we will usually use that notation,
      rather than <m>R</m>, to denote the relation.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    We are already familiar with some relations on
    <m>\R</m>. Common such relations are <m>=</m>, <m>\neq</m>, <m>\lt</m>, <m>\leq</m>, <m>></m>,
    and <m>\geq</m>; they contain exactly the elements we'd expect them to
    contain.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\lt</m> is a relation on <m>\R</m> that contains, for instance, <m>(3,4)</m> but not
            <m>(3,3)</m> or <m>(4,3)</m>; <m>\leq</m> is a relation on <m>\R</m> that contains
            <m>(3,4)</m> <em>and</em> <m>(3,3)</m> but not <m>(4,3)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Given any <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, congruence modulo <m>n</m>, denoted <m>\equiv_n</m>, is a
            relation on <m>\Z</m>, where <m>\equiv_n</m> is defined to be <m>\{(x,y) \in \Z
            \times \Z \,:\, n \text{ divides } x-y\}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We can define a relation <m>R</m> on <m>C^1</m> (the set of
            all differentiable functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>
            whose derivatives are continuous) by declaring that
            <m>(f,g)\in C^1 \times C^1</m> is in <m>R</m> if and only if
            <m>f'=g'</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a relation on a set <m>S</m>. Then <m>R</m> is said to
        be:
      </p>
<ul><li>
      <p>
        <term>reflexive on <m>S</m></term> if <m>xR x</m> for every <m>x\in S</m>;
      </p></li>
<li>
      <p>
        <term>symmetric on <m>S</m></term> if whenever <m>x,y\in S</m> with <m>xR y</m>
        we also have <m>yR x</m>; and</p></li>
<li>
      <p>
        <term>transitive on <m>S</m></term> if
        whenever <m>x,y,z\in S</m> with <m>xR y</m> and <m>yR z</m> we also have <m>xR z</m>.
      </p></li>
</ul>

      <p>
        A relation that is reflexive,
        symmetric, <term>and</term> transitive is called an <term>equivalence
        relation</term>.
      </p>
      <p> If we know, or plan to prove, that a relation is an equivalence
          relation, by convention we may denote the relation by <m>\sim</m>,
          rather than by <m>R</m>.</p>

          You can think of an
          equivalence relation on a set <m>S</m> as being a <q>weak version</q> of
          equality on <m>S</m>.  Indeed, <m>=</m> is an equivalence relation on any set
          <m>S</m>, but it also has a very special property that most equivalence
          relations <em>don't</em> have: namely, no element of <m>S</m> is related to
          <em>any other element</em> of <m>S</m> under <m>=</m>.

    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\lt</m> is <em>not</em> an equivalence relation on <m>\R</m> because
            it is not reflexive: for instance, <m>3\not\lt  3</m>. <m>\leq</m> is also <em>not</em> an equivalence relation on <m>\R</m>, since even though it is
            reflexive, it's not symmetric: indeed, <m>3\leq 4</m> but <m>4\not\leq 3</m>.

        <li>

            Given any <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, <m>\equiv_n</m> <em>is</em> an equivalence relation on <m>\Z</m>.  The proof of this is left as an exercise for the reader.

            The relation <m>R</m> on <m>C^1</m> discussed above (<m>fR  g</m> iff <m>f'=g'</m>) <em>is</em> an equivalence relation

            <m>x\in \Z</m>, <m>x^2\geq 0</m>, so <m>R</m> is reflexive.  Moreover, if <m>x,y\in
            \Z</m> with <m>xy \geq 0</m>, then <m>yx \geq 0</m>; so <m>R</m> is symmetric.  But
            <m>R</m> is <em>not</em> transitive: indeed, <m>3,0,-4\in \Z</m> with <m>3(0)=0
            \geq 0</m> and <m>0(-4)=0\geq 0</m>, so <m>3\R 0</m> and <m>0 R -4</m>; but
            <m>3(-4)=-12 \not \geq 0</m>.  So <m>R</m> isn't transitive, and hence is

    We have now the following Very Important
    Lemma:
  </p>

  <lemma xml:id="vil_lem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on set <m>S</m>. Then for <m>x,y\in S</m>, the following are equivalent:
<p>
<ol>
<li><p><m>y\in [x]</m>;</p></li>
<li><p><m>[x]=[y]</m>;</p></li>
<li><p><m>x\in [y]</m>.</p></li>
</ol>
     </p></p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      To prove that the first and second statements are equivalent: Let <m>x, y\in S</m>. If <m>y\in
      [x]</m>, then <m>y \sim x</m>, so for every <m>z\in [y]</m> (that is, for every
      <m>z</m> in <m>S</m> with <m>z\sim y</m>), we have, by transitivity, <m>z\sim x</m>, so
      <m>z\in [x]</m>. On the other hand, by the symmetry of <m>\sim</m> we have
      <m>x\sim y</m>; so for every <m>z\in [x]</m>, we have, again by transitivity,
      that <m>z\in [y]</m>. Thus, <m>[x]=[y]</m>. Conversely, if <m>[x]=[y]</m>, then
      since <m>y\in [y]=[x]</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proof that the second and third statements are equivalent is nearly
      identical.

  <proof>
    <p>
      To prove the first statement: Let <m>\sim</m> be an equivalence relation on <m>S</m>.
      Clearly, the equivalence classes of <m>S</m> under <m>\sim</m> are
      nonempty sets whose union is <m>S</m>. Thus, it suffices to show <m>X

      Finally, it is straightforward (almost silly!) to prove that

  <title>Introduction to cosets and normal subgroups</title>
  <p>
    Throughout this section, let <m>G</m> be a group with subgroup <m>H</m>
    and consider two particular relations on <m>G</m>:
    <m>\siml</m> defined by <m>a\siml b</m> if and only if
    <m>a^{-1}b\in H</m>and
    <m>\simr</m> defined by <m>a\simr b</m> if and only if
    <m>ab^{-1}\in H</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="simlreq">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\siml</m> and <m>\simr</m> are equivalence relations on <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      First, let <m>a\in G</m>. Then <m>a^{-1}a=e\in H</m>,
      so <m>a\siml a</m>. Thus, <m>\siml</m> is reflexive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, let <m>a,b\in G</m> with <m>a\siml b</m>. Then
      <m>a^{-1}b\in H</m>, so, since <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
      <m>(a^{-1}b)^{-1}\in H</m>. But
      <m>(a^{-1}b)^{-1}=b^{-1}(a^{-1})^{-1}=b^{-1}a</m>; thus, <m>b\siml a</m>, and so <m>\siml</m> is symmetric.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, let <m>a,b,c\in G</m> with <m>a\siml b</m>
      and <m>b\siml c</m>. Then <m>a^{-1}b</m> and <m>b^{-1}c</m> are in <m>H</m>. Since
      <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, we must then have
      <m>(a^{-1}b)(b^{-1}c)\in H</m>; but <m>(a^{-1}b)(b^{-1}c)</m> equals
      <m>a^{-1}c</m>. Thus, <m>a\siml c</m>, and so <m>\siml</m> is transitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, <m>\siml</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>G</m>. The proof that <m>\simr</m> is an equivalence relation is left as an exercise for the reader.
    </p>
  </proof>
</theorem>


  <p>
    Now, as equivalence relations, each of <m>\siml</m> and <m>\simr</m>
    gives rise to a partition of <m>G</m>. What are the cells of those
    partitions?
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given <m>a\in G</m>, we define
        <me>
          aH =
          \{ah\,:\, h\in H\}
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          Ha=\{ha\,:\,h\in H\}.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We call <m>aH</m> and <m>Ha</m>, respectively, the <term>left </term> and <term>right cosets of <m>H</m> containing
        <m>a</m></term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <theorem xml:id="equivca">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a\in G</m>. Then under <m>\siml</m>, <m>[a]=aH</m> while
        under <m>\simr</m>, <m>[a]=Ha</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>b\in G</m>. Then <m>b\siml a \Leftrightarrow a \siml b
      \Leftrightarrow a^{-1}b\in H \Leftrightarrow a^{-1}b=h</m> for some
      <m>h\in H \Leftrightarrow b=ah</m> for some <m>h\in H \Leftrightarrow b\in
      aH</m>. So under <m>\siml</m> we have <m>[a]=aH</m>. Similarly, under <m>\simr</m> we
      have <m>[a]=Ha</m>.

  </proof>
</theorem>

  <p>
    We next summarize some facts about the left and right cosets of
    a subgroup <m>H</m> of a group <m>G</m>:
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="cosetfacts">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group with <m>H\leq G</m> and <m>a,b\in G</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The left [right] cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> partition <m>G</m>.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <me>
                b\in aH \Leftrightarrow aH=bH \Leftrightarrow  a\in bH
              </me>
              and
              <me>
                b\in Ha \Leftrightarrow  Ha=Hb \Leftrightarrow  a\in
                Hb.
              </me>
              In particular, <m>a\in H \Leftrightarrow aH=H \Leftrightarrow Ha=H</m>.
            </p>

          <li>

              <m>H</m> is the only left or right coset of <m>H</m> that is a <em>subgroup</em>
              of <m>G</m>.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>|aH|=|H|=|Ha|</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
    <p>
      Statements 1 and 2 hold because the left and right
      cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> are equivalence classes. Statement 3
      holds because no left or right coset of <m>H</m> other than <m>H</m>
      itself can contain <m>e</m>, since the left [right] cosets of <m>H</m>
      are mutually disjoint. For Statement 4: Define <m>f\,:\,H\to aH</m> by <m>f(h)=ah</m>. It is straightforward to show that <m>f</m> is a bijection, so <m>|H|=|aH|</m>. Similarly, <m>|Ha|=|H|</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</theorem>

  <remark>
    <p>
      We can use Statements 2 and 3, above, to save some
      time when computing left and right cosets of a subgroup of a
      group.
    </p>

  <example xml:id="s3_ex">

      <p>The left cosets are <me>eH=H=(12)H,</me><me>(13)H=\{(13),(123)\}=(123)H,</me><me>\text{ and } (23)H=\{(23),(132)\}=(132)H,</me> and the

    We now draw attention to some very important facts:
  </p>

  <warning>
    <p>
      For <m>a,b\in G</m>:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            In general, <m>aH \neq Ha</m>!
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>aH=bH</m> does not necessarily imply <m>a=b</m> or that there exists
            an <m>h\in H</m> with <m>ah=bh</m>; similarly, <m>Ha=Hb</m> does not necessarily
            imply <m>a=b</m> or that there exists an <m>h\in H</m> with
            <m>ha=hb</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </warning>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We saw above that in <m>S_3</m> with <m>H=\langle (12)\rangle</m>,

        Also,

  <p>
    It turns out that subgroups <m>H</m> for which <m>aH=Ha</m> for all <m>a\in
    G</m> will be very important to us.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say that subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is <term>normal</term> in <m>G</m>
        if <m>aH=Ha</m> for all <m>a\in G</m>. We denote that fact that <m>H</m> is

  <remark>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, we may refer to the left and
          right cosets of <m>G</m> as simply <em>cosets</em>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Of course, if <m>G</m> is abelian, every subgroup of <m>G</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
          But there can also be normal subgroups of nonabelian groups: for instance, the trivial and improper
          subgroups of every group are normal in that group.

        Notice that in additive notation, the statement <q><m>a^{-1}b\in H</m></q>
        becomes <m>-a+b\in H</m>. So for <m>a,b\in \Z</m>, <m>a\siml b</m> if and only if <m>-a+b \in

        in this case, <m>\siml</m> is just congruence modulo <m>5</m>. Thus, the cosets of <m>5\Z</m> in <m>\Z</m> are

    infinite.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>(\R:\Z)</m> were finite, then we'd be able to

        Referring to our previous examples, we have:
