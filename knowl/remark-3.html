<p id="p-78">It turns out that countably infinite sets have the same cardinality as one another, while a countably infinite set and an uncountable set have different cardinalities. Intuitively, you  can think  of two countably infinite sets as having the same “size,” and a countable set and an uncountable set as having different “sizes”; however, this is a risky way of framing things, since it can  make some results seem counterintuitive when you're used to dealing only with finite sets (see, for instance, <a knowl="./knowl/zplus.html" knowl-id="xref-zplus" alt="Example 1.3.6 " title="Example 1.3.6 ">Example 1.3.6</a>).  Luckily, exploring the cardinality of infinite sets isn't the focus of this class.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#remark-3">in-context</a></span>
