<body><span class="footnote">A good question to ask here is why it's called “the” trivial group, rather than “a” trivial group.  Indeed, there are infinitely many groups of order 1! (Do you see why?) But it turns out that all of these groups are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>structurally</em> the same. Hence mathematicians end up thinking of them as various instantiations of one group, rather than separate groups. We will discuss this in more depth shortly, when we introduce the idea of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>isomorphism</em>.</span></body>
