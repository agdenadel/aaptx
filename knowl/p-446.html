<p>A rigorous proof of the fact that \(V\) and \(\Z_4\) are not isomorphic is as follows: For now, denote the usual operation on \(V\) by \(*\text{.}\) Suppose that \(V\) and \(\Z_4\) are isomorphic, via isomorphism \(\phi\) from \(V\) to \(\Z_4\text{.}\) Then since \(\phi\) is onto, there exists an element \(a\in V\) such that \(\phi(a)=3\text{.}\) Then</p>
\begin{align*}
3+3\amp =\phi(a)+\phi(a)\amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(a\)) }\\
\amp =\phi(a*a) \amp \amp \text{ (since \(\phi\) is a homomorphism) }\\
\amp =\phi((0,0)) \amp \amp \text{ (since every element of \(V\) is its own inverse) }\\
\amp =0, \amp \amp
\end{align*}
<p>since \(\phi\) is a homomorphism, so sends identity element to identity element. But this is a contradiction, since \(3+3=2\neq 0\) in \(\Z_4\text{.}\) Thus, \(V\not\simeq \Z_4\text{.}\)</p>
