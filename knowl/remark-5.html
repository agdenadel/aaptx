<p>For \(*\) to be a binary operation on \(S\text{,}\) \(a*b\) must be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>well defined</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in</em> \(\mathbf{S}\) for each \(a,b\in S\text{.}\) For instance, we cannot define a binary operation on \(\R\) by</p>
\begin{equation*}
a*b=\text{ the greatest number less than
\(a+b\)}
\end{equation*}
<p>since there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em>  no such “greatest number.” Nor can we define a binary operation on \(\Z\) by \(a*b=ab/2\text{,}\) since for, say, \(a=b=1 \in \Z\text{,}\) \(ab/2=1/2 \not\in \Z\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not every binary operation is denoted by \(*\text{.}\)  In fact, many already have common notations: for instance, \(+\) on \(\Z\) or \(\circ\) on the set of functions from \(\R\) to \(\R\text{.}\) We will assume these common notations represent the “usual” binary operations we know them to mean, unless otherwise noted.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not mix up the \(*\) that indicates a binary operation and the superscript \(^*\) that indicates that we are only considering the nonzero elements of a given set (e.g., \(\R^*\)). You should be able to tell which type of \(*\) we are using from context and placement. Also, make sure you correctly place these symbols!</p></li>
