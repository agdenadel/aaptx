          For \(*\) to be a binary operation on \(S\text{,}\) \(a*b\) must be
          <!--Style me with CSS--><em>well defined</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in</em> \(\mathbf{S}\) for each \(a,b\in S\text{.}\)
          For instance, we cannot define a binary operation on
          \(\R\) by
          \begin{equation*}
            a*b=\text{ the greatest number less than
            \(a+b\)}
          \end{equation*}
          since there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em>  no such “greatest number.”
          Nor can we define a binary operation on \(\Z\) by \(a*b=ab/2\text{,}\)
          since for, say, \(a=b=1 \in \Z\text{,}\) \(ab/2=1/2 \not\in \Z\text{.}\)
        </p></li>
<li id="li-54"><p id="p-140">
          Not every binary operation is denoted by \(*\text{.}\)  In fact, many already have common notations: for instance, \(+\) on \(\Z\) or \(\circ\) on the set of functions from \(\R\) to \(\R\text{.}\) We will assume these common notations represent the “usual” binary operations we know them to mean, unless otherwise noted.
        </p></li>
<li id="li-55"><p id="p-141">
          Do not mix up the \(*\) that indicates a binary operation and the
          superscript \(^*\) that indicates that we are only considering the
          nonzero elements of a given set (e.g., \(\R^*\)). You should be
          able to tell which type of \(*\) we are using from context and
          placement. Also, make sure you correctly place these symbols!
