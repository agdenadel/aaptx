      For Part 1: The identity map \(1_G:G\to G\) defined by
      \(1_G(a)=a\) for all \(a\in G\) is clearly an isomorphism.
    </p>
<p id="p-415">
      For Part 2: Since \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, it's a bijection, hence
      has inverse \(\phi^{-1}\text{.}\) From <a knowl="./knowl/invbij.html" knowl-id="xref-invbij" alt="Theorem 1.2.9 " title="Theorem 1.2.9 ">Theorem 1.2.9</a>, we know that
      \(\phi^{-1}\) must also be a bijection (in this case, from \(G'\) to
      \(G\)). So it suffices to show that \(\phi^{-1}\) is a homomorphism.
      Let \(a,b\in G'\text{.}\) We want to show that
      \(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b)=\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b)\text{.}\) Since \(\phi\) is 1-1, it suffices to show that
      \begin{equation*}
        \phi(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b))=\phi(\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b)).
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p id="p-416">
      Notice, we have
      \(\phi(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b))=a\cdot'b\text{;}\) further, we have
      \begin{equation*}
        \phi(\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b))=\phi(\phi^{-1}(a))\cdot'\phi(\phi^{-1}(b))=a\cdot'b.
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p id="p-417">
      This shows that
      \(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b)=\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b)\text{,}\) as desired.
    </p>
<p id="p-418">
      For Part 3: Since \(G\simeq G'\) and \(G'\simeq G''\text{,}\) there exist
      isomorphisms \(\phi:G\to G'\) and \(\psi:G'\to G''\text{.}\) Define
      \(\theta:G\to G''\) by \(\theta=\psi \circ \phi\text{.}\) Since \(\phi\) and
      \(\psi\) are both bijections, \(\theta\) is a bijection (<a knowl="./knowl/compbij.html" knowl-id="xref-compbij" alt="Theorem 1.2.11 " title="Theorem 1.2.11 ">Theorem 1.2.11</a>). Next, let \(a,b\in G\text{.}\) The
      \begin{align*}
\theta(a\cdot b)\amp =\psi(\phi(a\cdot b))\amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(\theta\)) }\\
\amp =\psi(\phi(a)\cdot'\phi(b))\amp \amp \text{ (since \(\phi\) is a homomorphism) }\\
\amp =\psi(\phi(a))\cdot''\psi(\phi(b))\amp \amp \text{ (since \(\psi\) is a homomorphism) }\\
\amp =\theta(a)\cdot''\theta(b)\amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(\theta\)) } .
\end{align*}
    </p>
<p id="p-419">
      Thus, \(\theta\) is a homomorphism, and hence, since it is also a bijection, an isomorphism.
