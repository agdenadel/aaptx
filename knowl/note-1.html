<p>Let \(S\) be the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves.  Is \(S\) a member of itself? If you think carefully about this, you'll see that \(S\) can be neither a member of itself, nor <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a member of itself. Uh oh!  This contradiction is known as “Russell's paradox” (named for the British philosopher, mathematician, and all-round academic Bertrand Russell). Mathematicians deal with this by declaring that some object collections, called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>classes</em>, are not in fact sets.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-1.html#note-1">in-context</a></span>
