<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>For Part 1: The identity map \(1_G:G\to G\) defined by \(1_G(a)=a\) for all \(a\in G\) is clearly an isomorphism.</p>
<p>For Part 2: Since \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, it's a bijection, hence has inverse \(\phi^{-1}\text{.}\) From <a knowl="./knowl/invbij.html" knowl-id="xref-invbij" alt="Theorem 1.2.9 " title="Theorem 1.2.9 ">Theorem 1.2.9</a>, we know that \(\phi^{-1}\) must also be a bijection (in this case, from \(G'\) to \(G\)). So it suffices to show that \(\phi^{-1}\) is a homomorphism. Let \(a,b\in G'\text{.}\) We want to show that \(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b)=\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b)\text{.}\) Since \(\phi\) is 1-1, it suffices to show that</p>
\begin{equation*}
\phi(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b))=\phi(\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b)).
\end{equation*}
<p>Notice, we have \(\phi(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b))=a\cdot'b\text{;}\) further, we have</p>
\begin{equation*}
\phi(\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b))=\phi(\phi^{-1}(a))\cdot'\phi(\phi^{-1}(b))=a\cdot'b.
\end{equation*}
<p>This shows that \(\phi^{-1}(a\cdot'b)=\phi^{-1}(a)\cdot\phi^{-1}(b)\text{,}\) as desired.</p>
<p>For Part 3: Since \(G\simeq G'\) and \(G'\simeq G''\text{,}\) there exist isomorphisms \(\phi:G\to G'\) and \(\psi:G'\to G''\text{.}\) Define \(\theta:G\to G''\) by \(\theta=\psi \circ \phi\text{.}\) Since \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are both bijections, \(\theta\) is a bijection (<a knowl="./knowl/compbij.html" knowl-id="xref-compbij" alt="Theorem 1.2.11 " title="Theorem 1.2.11 ">Theorem 1.2.11</a>). Next, let \(a,b\in G\text{.}\) The</p>
\begin{align*}
\theta(a\cdot b)\amp =\psi(\phi(a\cdot b))\amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(\theta\)) }\\
\amp =\psi(\phi(a)\cdot'\phi(b))\amp \amp \text{ (since \(\phi\) is a homomorphism) }\\
\amp =\psi(\phi(a))\cdot''\psi(\phi(b))\amp \amp \text{ (since \(\psi\) is a homomorphism) }\\
\amp =\theta(a)\cdot''\theta(b)\amp \amp \text{ (by definition of \(\theta\)) } .
\end{align*}
<p>Thus, \(\theta\) is a homomorphism, and hence, since it is also a bijection, an isomorphism.</p></article></body>
