    We may omit the \(*\) and \(*'\text{,}\) as per our group conventions, but we include them here to emphasize that the operations in the structures may be distinct from one another. When we omit them and write \(\phi(st)=\phi(s)\phi(t)\text{,}\) then it is the writers' and readers' responsibility to keep in mind that \(s\) and \(t\) are being operated together using the operation in \(S\text{,}\) while \(\phi(s)\) and \(\phi(t)\) are being operated together using the operation in \(S'\text{.}\)
