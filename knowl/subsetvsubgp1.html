<li><p>Consider the subset \(\Z\) of the group \(\Q\text{,}\) assuming that \(\Q\) is equipped with the usual addition of real numbers (as we indicated above that we would assume, by default).  Since we already know that \(\Z\) is a group under this operation, \(\Z\) is not just a subset but in fact a subgroup of \(\Q\) (under addition).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead, consider the subset \(\Q^+\) of the group \(\Q\text{.}\)  This subset is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a group under \(\Q\)'s operation \(+\text{,}\) since it does not contain an identity element for \(+\text{.}\)  Therefore, \(\Q^+\) is a subset but not a subgroup of \(\Q\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Let \(I\) be the subset</p>
\begin{equation*}
I=\R-\Q=\{x\in \R: x
\text{ is irrational} \}
\end{equation*}
<p>of the group \(\R\text{.}\) The set \(I\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a group under \(\R\)'s operation \(+\) since it is not closed under addition: for instance, \(\pi, -\pi \in I\text{,}\) but \(\pi+(-\pi)=0\not\in I\text{.}\)  So \(I\) is a subset but not a subgroup of \(\R\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider the subset \(\Z^+\) of the group \(\R^+\text{.}\) The set \(\Z^+\) is closed under multiplication, multiplication is associative on \(\Z^+\text{,}\) and \(\Z^+\) does contain an identity element (namely, 1).  However, most elements of \(\Z^+\) do not have inverses in \(\Z^+\) under multiplication: for instance, the inverse of \(3\) would have to be \(1/3\text{,}\) but \(1/3\not\in \Z^+\text{.}\)  Therefore, \(\Z^+\) is a subset but not a subgroup of \(\R^+\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the subset \(GL(n,\R)\) of \(\M_n(\R)\text{.}\)  We know that \(GL(n,\R)\) is a group, so it might be tempting to say that it is a subgroup of \(\M_n(\R)\text{;}\) to be a subgroup of \(\M_n(\R)\text{,}\) \(GL(n,\R)\) must be a group under \(\M_n(\R)\)'s operation, which is matrix addition.  While \(GL(n,\R)\) is a group under matrix multiplication, it is not a group under matrix addition: for instance, it is not closed under matrix addition, since \(I_n, -I_n\in GL(n,\R)\) but \(I_n+(-I_n)\) is the matrix consisting of all zeros, which is not in \(GL(n,\R)\text{.}\) So \(GL(n,\R)\) is a subset but not a subgroup of \(\M_n(\R)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the subset \(H=\{0,2\}\) of \(\Z_4\text{.}\)  The subset \(H\) is closed under addition modulo 4 (\(0+0=0\text{,}\) \(0+2=2+0=2\text{,}\) \(2+2=0\)), addition modulo 4 is always associative, \(H\) contains an identity element (namely, 0) under addition modulo 4, and both 0 and 2 have inverses in \(\Z_4\) under this operation (0 and 2 are each their own inverses).  Thus, \(H\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> a subgroup of \(\Z_4\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(G\) be a group.  Then \(\{e_G\}\) and \(G\) are clearly both subgroups of \(G\text{.}\)</p></li>
