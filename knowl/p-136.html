    So far we have been discussing sets. These are extremely simple
    objects, essentially mathematical “bags of stuff.” Without any
    added structure, their usefulness is very limited. Imagine, for
    instance, living with friends in a two-story house without rooms,
    stairs, closets, or hallways. You have no privacy, cannot access the
    second floor, etc. A set with no added structure will not help us,
    say, solve a linear equation. What <!--Style me with CSS--><em>will</em> help us with such
    things are objects such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces.
    These are sets equipped with <!--Style me with CSS--><em>binary operations</em> which allow us
    to combine set elements in various ways. We first rigorously define
    a binary operation.
