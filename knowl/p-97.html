<p>It is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> true that any countable product of countable (or even finite) sets is countable. Indeed, even the set \(\{0,1\}\times \{0,1\}\times \cdots\) is uncountable. (If you want to get into the gory details of this, the key is that there is a bijection from this set to the power set of the natural numbers, which Cantor's Theorem tells us is uncountable.  You are welcome to jump down this rabbit hole by googling “Cantor's Theorem,” if you desire, but know that you will not be responsible for that material in class.)</p>
