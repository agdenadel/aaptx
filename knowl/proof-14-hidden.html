<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>We first check that \(\Z_n\) is closed under \(+_n\text{.}\) Note that by the definition of \(+_n\text{,}\) \(a+_nb \in \Z_n\) for each \(a,b\in \Z\text{.}\) Thus, \(a+_nb \in \Z_n\) for each \(a,b\in \Z_n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We next check that \(\Z_n\) under \(+_n\) satisfies the three group axioms. Note that since addition is commutative on \(\Z\text{,}\)</p>
\begin{equation*}
a+_n
b =R_n(a+b)=R_n(b+a)=b+_n a
\end{equation*}
<p>for all \(a,b\in \Z_n\text{.}\) Again, a simpler way of stating this is that commutativity of \(+_n\) on \(\Z_n\) is inherited from the commutativity of addition on \(\Z\text{.}\) One nice result of this is that since \(+_n\) is commutative on \(\Z_n\text{,}\) we have less to check when verifying group axioms \(\G_2\) and \(\G_3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now, let \(a,b,c\in \Z_n\text{.}\)  We want to show that \((a+_n b)+_n c = a +_n(b+_n c)\text{.}\) Now,</p>
\begin{align*}
(a+_n b)+_n c\amp =R_n(a+b)+_n c\amp \amp\\
\amp \equiv R_n(a+b)+c\amp \amp  \pmod n\\
\amp \equiv (a+b)+c\amp \amp   \pmod n\\
\amp \equiv a+(b+c)\amp \amp   \pmod n\\
\amp \equiv a+R_n(b+c)\amp \amp   \pmod n\\
\amp \equiv a+_n (b+_n c)\amp \amp  \pmod n.
\end{align*}
<p>So \((a+_n b)+_n c\) and \(a+_n (b+_n c)\) are congruent mod \(n\text{.}\)  Since both of these values are in \(\{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}\text{,}\) this implies that they are equal, as desired.</p>
<p>Next, clearly, \(0\in \Z_n\) acts as an identity element under \(+_n\text{,}\) since</p>
\begin{equation*}
0+_n a =R_n(0+a)=R_n(a)
\end{equation*}
<p>for each \(a\in \Z_n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finally, let \(a\in \Z_n\text{.}\)  If \(a=0\text{,}\) then clearly \(a\) has inverse \(0\in \Z_n\) since \(0+_n 0 = 0\text{.}\) If \(a\neq 0\text{,}\) then the element \(n-a\in \Z_n\) is an inverse for \(a\) since</p>
\begin{equation*}
a+_n(n-a)=R_n(a+(n-a))=R_n(n)=0.
\end{equation*}
<p>Since \(+_n\) is commutative on \(\Z_n\text{,}\) \(\Z_n\) is an abelian group under \(+_n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finally, we already know that \(|\Z_n|=|\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}|=n\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
