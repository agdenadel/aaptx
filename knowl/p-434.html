<p>We have now seen examples in which we have proved that two groups are isomorphic. How, though, do we prove that two groups are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> isomorphic? It is usually wildly impractical, if not impossible, to check that no function from one group to the other is an isomorphism. For instance, it turns out that \(\R^*\) is not isomorphic to \(GL(2,\R)\) (see <a knowl="./knowl/rgl.html" knowl-id="xref-rgl" alt="Example 3.3.14 " title="Example 3.3.14 ">Example 14</a>), but there are infinitely many bijections from \(\R^*\) to \(GL(2,\R)\)—it is impossible to check that each one is not an isomorphism. Instead, we use <!--Style me with CSS--><em>group invariants</em>.</p>
