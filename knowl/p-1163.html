    In the above examples, we were able to identify \(G/N\) up to
    isomorphism relatively easily because we could determine that \(G/N\)
    was cyclic. In general, however, it can be quite difficult to
    identify the group structure of a factor group. We explore some
    powerful tools we can use in this identification in the next
    section, but first we note a couple properties of \(G\) that are
    “inherited” by any of its factor groups.
