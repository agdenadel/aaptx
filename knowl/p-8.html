    Let \(S\) be the set of all sets that aren't members
    of themselves.  Is \(S\) a member of itself? If you think carefully
    about this, you'll see that \(S\) can be neither a member of itself,
    nor <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a member of itself. Uh oh!  This contradiction
    is known as “Russell's paradox” (named for the British philosopher, mathematician, and all-round academic Bertrand Russell). Mathematicians deal with this by
    declaring that some object collections, called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>classes</em>, are
    not in fact sets.</p>
