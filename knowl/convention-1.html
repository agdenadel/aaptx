<li id="li-91">
<p id="p-235"> We usually <!--Style me with CSS--><em>don't</em> use the notation \(*\) when describing group
          operations. Instead, we use the multiplication symbol \(\cdot\) for
          the operation in an arbitrary group, and  call
          applying the operation “multiplying”—even though the operation may
          not be “multiplication” in the non-abstract, traditional sense! It may
          actually be addition of real numbers, composition of
          functions, etc. Moreover, when actually operating in a group \(\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle\text{,}\) we
          typically omit the \(\cdot\) . That is, for \(a,b\in G\text{,}\) we write the
          product \(a\cdot b\) as \(ab\text{.}\) We call this the “product” of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) </p>
<p id="p-236">
          For every element \(a\) in a group \(\Gdot\) and \(n\in \Z^+\text{,}\) we use the expression \(a^n\) to denote  the product \begin{equation*}a \times a \times \cdots \times a\end{equation*} of \(n\) copies of \(a\text{,}\) 
      and \(a^{-n}\) to denote \((a^{-1})^n\) (that is, the product of \(n\) copies of \(a^{-1}\)).
          Finally, we define \(a^0\) to be \(e\text{.}\)  Note that our “usual” rules for exponents then hold in an arbitrary group: that is, if \(a\) is in group \(\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle\)
          and \(m,n\in \Z\text{,}\) then \(a^m a^n = a^{m+n}\) and \((a^m)^n=a^{mn}=(a^n)^m\text{.}\)
        </p>
<p id="p-237">However:</p>
</li>
<li id="li-92">
<p id="p-238">When we know our operation is commutative, we typically
            continue to use additive notation (\(+\) for the group operation, \(-a\)
            for the inverse of element \(a\) in the group) and call the operation
            “addition,” though using \(\cdot\) is also valid in these cases. When
            we use additive notation, we do <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> omit the \(+\) when
            operating in a group \(\langle G,+\rangle\text{,}\) and we call \(a+b\) a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sum</em> rather
            than a product. Also, when working with an operation that is known to be commutative, the identity element may be denoted by 0 rather than by \(e\text{,}\) \(e_G\text{,}\) or 1, and for \(n\in \N\text{,}\) we write \(na\) instead of \(a^n\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-239">Finally, note that
            \((-n)a=n(-a)=-(na)\) (where \(-a\) and \(-(na)\) indicate the
            additive inverses of \(a\) and \(na\text{,}\) respectively); we can therefore
            unambiguously use the notation \(-na\) for this element.
            Using this notation, note that for \(m\in \Z\text{,}\) \(na+ma=(n+m)a\) and \(n(ma)=(nm)a\text{.}\)</p>
