<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Assume \(f\) and \(g\) are 1-1. Let \(s_1, s_2\in S\) with \((g\circ f)(s_1)=(g\circ f)(s_2)\text{.}\) Then \(g(f(s_1))=g(f(s_2))\text{;}\) since \(g\) is one-to-one (since it's a bijection), this shows that \(f(s_1)=f(s_2)\text{.}\) Then since \(f\) is one-to-one (since \(f\) is also a bijection), we must have \(s_1=s_2\text{.}\) Thus, \(g\circ f\) is one-to-one.</p>
<p>The proof that \(g\circ f\) is onto if \(f\) and \(g\) are onto is left as an exercise for the reader.</p></article></body>
