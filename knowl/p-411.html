    Isomorphic groups have <!--Style me with CSS--><em>the same structure</em> as far as
    algebraists are concerned. Again, picture two houses that are
    identical except for the colors they are painted. Though they
    differ in some ways (one house is red while the other is
    green), they are structurally identical. Isomorphic groups
    have identical structures, though the elements of one group may
    differ greatly from those of the other. Returning to the house
    analogy: if two houses are structurally identical, we can learn
    many things about one house by looking at the other (e.g., how
    many bathrooms it has, whether it has a basement, etc.).
    Similarly, suppose we know a great deal about group \(G\) and are
    given a new group, \(G'\text{.}\). If we prove that \(G'\) is isomorphic
    to \(G\text{,}\), then we can likely deduce information about \(G'\) from
    the information we know about \(G\text{.}\).
