    This is only sort of  a “definition” because it is not a
    rigorous definition of a set. For instance, what do we mean by a
    “collection” of objects? This “definition” will be sufficient for
    our course, but be warned that defining a set in this vague way can
    lead to some serious mathematical issues, such as <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Russell's
    paradox</em>.  A mathematician whose expertise is in set
    theory may scowl disagreeably if you try to define a set as we have
    above.
