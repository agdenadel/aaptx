<p>At this point you may be asking yourself, why do we care? We've covered a lot of definitions and proved some theorems, but what is the goal of all this? Well, there are actually many goals that we can achieve using such material. Consider the following as an example. Suppose we want to solve the equation \(5+x=2\text{.}\) We can probably solve this quite easily almost just by looking at it (\(x=-3\)), but what facts are we actually using there? If we break down the reasoning leading to this answer, we may obtain something like the following set of steps.</p>
