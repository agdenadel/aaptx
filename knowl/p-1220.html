    We provide one more cool example of using the <a knowl="./knowl/fit.html" knowl-id="xref-fit" alt="Theorem 9.1.6 First Isomorphism Theorem" title="Theorem 9.1.6 First Isomorphism Theorem">9.1.6</a>. Clearly, since \(\R\) is abelian, \(\Z\) is a normal
    subgroup of \(\R\text{.}\). What is the structure of \(\R/\Z\text{?}\)? Well, in
    modding \(\R\) out by \(\Z\) we have essentially identified together
    all real numbers that are an integer distance apart. So we can
    think of the canonical epimorphism from \(\R\) to \(\R/\Z\) as
    wrapping up \(\R\) like a garden hose! Thus, one might guess that
    \(\R/\Z\) has some circle-like structure—but if we want to think
    of it as a group, we have to figure out what the group structure on
    such a “circle” would be!
