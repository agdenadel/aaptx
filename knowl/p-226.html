<p>When working with an operation that is known to be commutative, we typically continue to use additive notation (\(+\) for the group operation, \(-a\) for the inverse of element \(a\) in the group) and call the operation “addition,” though using \(\cdot\) is also valid in these cases. When we use additive notation, we do <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> omit the \(+\) when operating in a group \(\langle G,+\rangle\text{,}\) and we call \(a+b\) a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sum</em> rather than a product. Also, when working with an operation that is known to be commutative, the identity element may be denoted by 0 rather than by \(e\text{,}\) \(e_G\text{,}\) or 1, and for \(n\in \N\text{,}\) we write \(na\) instead of \(a^n\text{.}\)</p>
