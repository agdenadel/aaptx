    It is important for us to be able to easily describe specific elements of \(S_n\text{.}\). It would be cumbersome to describe, for instance, an element of \(S_3\) by saying it swaps \(1\) and \(2\) and fixes \(3\text{;}\); imagine how much more cumbersome it could be to describe an element of, say, \(S_{100}\text{!}\)! One can somewhat concisely describe a permutation \(\sigma\) of \(S_n\) by listing out the elements \(1,2,\ldots,n\) and writing the element \(\sigma(i)\) below each \(i\) for \(i=1,2,\ldots, n\text{.}\).
    For instance, if \(\sigma\) sends \(1\) to \(2\text{,}\), we'd write the number \(2\) below the number \(1\text{.}\). The convention is to enclose these two rows of numbers in a single set of parentheses, as in the following example.
