<p>Consider the subset \(GL(n,\R)\) of \(\M_n(\R)\text{.}\)  We know that \(GL(n,\R)\) is a group, so it might be tempting to say that it is a subgroup of \(\M_n(\R)\text{;}\) to be a subgroup of \(\M_n(\R)\text{,}\) \(GL(n,\R)\) must be a group under \(\M_n(\R)\)'s operation, which is matrix addition.  While \(GL(n,\R)\) is a group under matrix multiplication, it is not a group under matrix addition: for instance, it is not closed under matrix addition, since \(I_n, -I_n\in GL(n,\R)\) but \(I_n+(-I_n)\) is the matrix consisting of all zeros, which is not in \(GL(n,\R)\text{.}\) So \(GL(n,\R)\) is a subset but not a subgroup of \(\M_n(\R)\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-13.html#li-184">in-context</a></span>
