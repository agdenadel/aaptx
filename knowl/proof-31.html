<p>We first show that \(D_3\) is closed under composition. As noted above, \(rf=fr^2\text{.}\) So any map of the form \(f^ir^jf^kr^l\) (\(i,k=0,1\text{,}\) \(j,l=0,1,2\)) can be written in the form \(f^sr^t\) for some \(s,t \in \N\text{.}\) Finally, let \(R_2(s)\) and \(R_3(t)\) be the remainders when you divide \(s\) by \(2\) and \(t\) by \(3\text{;}\) then \(f^sr^t=f^{R_2(s)}r^{R_3(t)} \in D_3\text{.}\) So \(D_3\) is closed under composition.</p>
<p>Next, function composition is always associative, and the function \(e\) clearly acts as identity element in \(D_3\text{.}\) Finally, let \(x=f^ir^j\in D_3\text{.}\) Then \(y=r^{3-j}f^{2-i}\) is in \(D_3\) (since \(D_3\) is closed under composition) with \(xy=yx=e\text{.}\) So \(D_3\) is a group.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="dihedralgps.html#proof-31">in-context</a></span>
