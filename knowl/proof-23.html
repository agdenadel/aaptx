    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Case 1.</em> There is no positive integer \(k\) with \(a^k=e\text{.}\) In this case, we claim \(\langle a\rangle \simeq \Z\text{.}\) Indeed: Let \(\phi:\Z\to \langle a\rangle\) be defined by \(\phi(i)=a^i\text{.}\) Clearly, \(\phi\) is a homomorphism that is onto. So to show that \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, it suffices to show that \(\phi\) is one-to-one. Let \(i,j\in \Z\) with \(\phi(i)=\phi(j)\text{.}\) Then \(a^i=a^j\text{.}\) Without loss of generality, we may assume \(i\geq j\text{.}\) Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by \(a^{-j}\) (on the right or on the left) we obtain \(a^{i-j}=e\text{.}\) Since \(i-j\in \N\) and there is no positive integer \(k\) with \(a^k=e\text{,}\) we must have \(i-j=0\text{,}\) so \(i=j\text{.}\) Thus, \(\phi\) is an isomorphism from \(\Z\) to \(\langle a\rangle\text{.}\)

    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Case 2.</em>  There is a positive integer \(k\) such that \(a^k=e\text{.}\) In this case, let \(n\) be the least such positive integer. Define \(\phi:\Z_n\to \langle a\rangle\) be defined by \(\phi(i)=a^i\text{.}\) We claim that \(\phi\) is an isomorphism.

<p id="p-613"> First, let \(i,j\in \Z\text{.}\) We want to show that \(\phi(i+_nj)=\phi(i)\phi(j)\text{,}\) that is, that \(a^{i+_nj}=a^ia^j\text{.}\) Since \(i+j\) is congruent to \(i+_nj\) modulo \(n\text{,}\) \(a^ia^j=a^{i+j}=a^{i+_nj}\text{,}\) by the <a knowl="./knowl/clock.html" knowl-id="xref-clock" alt="Lemma 5.1.8 Clock Lemma" title="Lemma 5.1.8 Clock Lemma">5.1.8</a>. So \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. Next we show that \(\phi\) is one-to-one. Let \(i,j\in \Z_n\) with \(\phi(i)=\phi(j)\text{,}\) so \(a^i=a^j\text{.}\) Then, by the Clock Lemma, \(i\) and \(j\) are congruent modulo \(n\text{.}\) Since they're both in \(\Z_n\text{,}\) they must be equal,
    so \(\phi\) is one-to-one. Finally, we show that \(\phi\) is onto. let \(x\in \langle a\rangle\text{.}\) Then \(x=a^i\) for some \(i\in \Z\text{.}\) Letting \(r\) be the remainder when we divide \(i\) by \(n\text{,}\) we have \(r\in \Z_n\) with \(i\) congruent to \(r\) modulo \(n\text{;}\) so, again using the <a knowl="./knowl/clock.html" knowl-id="xref-clock" alt="Lemma 5.1.8 Clock Lemma" title="Lemma 5.1.8 Clock Lemma">5.1.8</a>, \(x=a^i=a^r\text{.}\) Since \(r\in \Z_n\text{,}\) \(x=\phi(r)\text{.}\) So \(\phi\) is onto.</p>
<p id="p-614">Thus, \(\phi\) is an isomorphism, and so in this case we have \(\Z_n \simeq \langle a \rangle\text{.}\)
