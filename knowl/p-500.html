<p>Note that in the cases above, we saw subsets of groups fail to be subgroups because they were not closed under the groups' operations; because they did not contain identity elements; or because they didn't contain an inverse for each of their elements. None, however, failed because the relevant group's operation was not associative on them. This is not a coincidence: rather, since any element of a subset of a group \(G\) also lives in \(G\text{,}\) any associative operation on \(G\) is of necessity associative on any closed subset of \(G\text{.}\) Therefore, when we are checking to see if \(H\subseteq G\) is a subgroup of group \(G\text{,}\) we need only check for closure, an identity element, and inverses.</p>
