<p>There are exceptions to these conventions: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>When working with an operation that is known to be commutative, we typically continue to use additive notation (\(+\) for the group operation, \(-a\) for the inverse of element \(a\) in the group) and call the operation “addition,” though using \(\cdot\) is also valid in these cases. When we use additive notation, we do <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> omit the \(+\) when operating in a group \(\langle G,+\rangle\text{,}\) and we call \(a+b\) a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sum</em> rather than a product. Also, when working with an operation that is known to be commutative, the identity element may be denoted by 0 rather than by \(e\text{,}\) \(e_G\text{,}\) or 1, and for \(n\in \N\text{,}\) we write \(na\) instead of \(a^n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finally, note that \((-n)a=n(-a)=-(na)\) (where \(-a\) and \(-(na)\) indicate the additive inverses of \(a\) and \(na\text{,}\) respectively); we can therefore unambiguously use the notation \(-na\) for this element. Using this notation, note that for \(m\in \Z\text{,}\) \(na+ma=(n+m)a\) and \(n(ma)=(nm)a\text{.}\)</p>

<p>Be careful to always know where an element you are working with lives! For instance, if, as above, \(n\in
\Z^+\) and \(a\) is a group element, \(-n\) and \(-a\) look similar but may mean very different things. While \(-n\) is a negative integer, \(-a\) may be the additive inverse of a matrix in \(\M_2(\R)\text{,}\) the additive inverse 2 of the number 4 in \(\Z_6\text{,}\) or even something completely unrelated to numbers.</p></article></p>

<p>Multiplicative notation can be used when working with any arbitary group, while additive notation should be used only when working with a group whose binary operation is commutative.</p></article></p>
<p>We summarize multiplicative versus addition notation in the following table, where \(a,b\) are elements of a group \(G\text{.}\)</p>

</li>
<li><p>We <!--Style me with CSS--><em>do</em> use the notation \(*\) when using multiplicative or additive notation would lead to confusion. For instance, if we want to define an operation on \(\Q^*\) that assigns to pair \((a,b)\) the quantity \(ab/2\text{,}\) it would be unwise to use multiplicative or additive notation for this operation since we already have conventional meanings of \(ab\) and \(a+b\text{.}\) Similarly, we would not denote the identity element of \(\Q^*\) under this operation by \(0\) or \(1\text{,}\) since the identity element in this group is the rational number \(2\text{,}\) and writing \(0=2\) or \(1=2\) would look weird.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a default notation for a particular operation (say, \(\circ\) for composition of functions) or identity element (say, \(I_n\) in \(GL(n,\R)\)) we usually use that notation instead.</p></li>
