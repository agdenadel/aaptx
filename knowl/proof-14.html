        We first check that \(\Z_n\) is closed under \(+_n\text{.}\) Note
        that by the definition of \(+_n\text{,}\) \(a+_nb \in \Z_n\) for each
        \(a,b\in \Z\text{.}\) Thus, \(a+_nb \in \Z_n\) for each \(a,b\in \Z_n\text{.}\)
      </p>
<p id="p-291">
        We next check that \(\Z_n\) under \(+_n\) satisfies the three group
        axioms. Note that since addition is commutative on \(\Z\text{,}\)
        \begin{equation*}
          a+_n
          b =R_n(a+b)=R_n(b+a)=b+_n a
        \end{equation*}
        for all \(a,b\in \Z_n\text{.}\) Again, a
        simpler way of stating this is that commutativity of \(+_n\) on
        \(\Z_n\) is inherited from the commutativity of addition on \(\Z\text{.}\)
        One nice result of this is that since \(+_n\) is commutative on
        \(\Z_n\text{,}\) we have less to check when verifying group axioms
        \(\G_2\) and \(\G_3\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-292">
              Now, let \(a,b,c\in \Z_n\text{.}\)  We want to show that
              \((a+_n b)+_n c = a +_n(b+_n c)\text{.}\) Now,
              \begin{align*}
(a+_n b)+_n c\amp =R_n(a+b)+_n c\\
\amp \equiv_n R_n(a+b)+c\\\
\amp \equiv_n (a+b)+c\\\
\amp \equiv_n a+(b+c)\\
\amp \equiv_n a+R_n(b+c)\\
\amp \equiv_n a+_n (b+_n c).
\end{align*}
              So \((a+_n b)+_n c\) and \(a+_n (b+_n c)\) are congruent mod \(n\text{.}\)  Since
              both of these values are in \(\{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}\text{,}\) this implies that
              they are equal, as desired.
            </p>

              Next, clearly, \(0\in \Z_n\) acts as an identity element
              under \(+_n\text{,}\) since
              \begin{equation*}
                0+_n a =R_n(0+a)=R_n(a)
              \end{equation*}
              for each
              \(a\in \Z_n\text{.}\)
            </p>
<p id="p-294">Finally, let \(a\in \Z_n\text{.}\)  If \(a=0\text{,}\) then clearly \(a\) has
              inverse \(0\in \Z_n\) since \(0+_n 0 = 0\text{.}\) If \(a\neq 0\text{,}\) then
              the element \(n-a\in \Z_n\) is an inverse for \(a\) since
              \begin{equation*}
                a+_n(n-a)=R_n(a+(n-a))=R_n(n)=0.
              \end{equation*}

        Since \(+_n\) is commutative on \(\Z_n\text{,}\) \(\Z_n\) is an abelian group under \(+_n\text{.}\) </p>
<p id="p-296">
Finally, we already know that \(|\Z_n|=|\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}|=n\text{.}\)
