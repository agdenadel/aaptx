    The key idea here for us is that if two sets are
    essentially “the same,” then they must have the same “size.”
    Thus, we see that there is some fundamental difference between
    the sets \(\Z\) and \(\R\) (in fact, there are many such
    differences). On the other hand, cardinality alone won't allow
    us to distinguish structurally between the sets \(\Z\) and
    \(\Z^+\text{.}\).
